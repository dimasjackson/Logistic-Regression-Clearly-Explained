This model is also know as Logit and it is characterized by a single binary dependent variable, i. e. a variable that only can take two values, often labeled as 0 and 1. Binary values are widely udsed in statistics to model the probablity of a certain event occuring, such as the probability of a pacient being health, a tumor being malignant or not, if an email is spam or not and if a team win or loose. Therefore, Logistic Regression has a large variety of applications. \n","\n","The logistic function is defined by:\n","$$ p(x) = \\dfrac{1}{1+e^{-(x-\\mu)/s}} $$\n","where $\\mu$ is the midpoint of the curve ($p(\\mu)=1/2$) and $s$ a scale parameter that determines the spread of the probability distribution. This function is also called **sigmoid function**, because of its 's' shape.\n","\n","The logistic fuction is used to generate predictions as we will see below. Furthermore, it is interesting to write this function as \n","$$ p(x) = \\dfrac{1}{1+e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x)}} \\,,$$ \n","where $\\beta_0 = -\\mu/s$ is the intercept of the line $y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x$ and $\\beta_1 = 1/s$ is its slope. The parameter $\\beta_0$ is also called \"bias\" and $\\beta_1$ \"weights\". The particular values of these quantities that maximizes the likelyhood function are what we need to find to make predictions."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"49339e6d","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-01-20T20:37:18.291673Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-01-20T20:37:18.291141Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-01-20T20:37:18.30292Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-01-20T20:37:18.301875Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.022263,"end_time":"2023-01-20T20:37:18.304834","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-01-20T20:37:18.282571","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["#

As an example, consider the case of a group of students which are preparing for a exam. The question is: how does the number of study hours affect the probability of the student passing the exam? In this case the explanatory variable is the number of hours studying and the two categories are being approved or not. Let's consider 10 students that spends between 0 to 10 hours studing and use 1 to identify \"pass\" and 0 to \"fail\".
